Safer Warfighter Communications  (SAFER)

The SAFER program seeks to develop technology that will enable safe, resilient communications over the Internet, particularly in situations in which a third party is attempting to discover the identity or location of the end users, or block communications.  The technology developed in the program will also provide the quality of service required to support applications such as electronic mail, instant messaging, voice over IP, and other media that promote effective communication.

Software:
[{"SAFER Team":"Georgetown University","Software Name":"Senser","Link":"https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/projects/senser/","Software Description":"Senser is a distributed censorship detection and circumvention system for the web. Senser operates as a network of proxies located at different vantage points on the Internet (some of which may be subject to censorship). Clients query a random subset of Senser proxies for compact descriptions of a desired web page, and apply consensus and matching algorithms to the returned results to locally render a “majority” web page. To ensure diverse selections of proxies (and consequently decrease an adversary’s ability to censor a majority of them), Senser leverages Internet mapping systems that accurately predict AS-level paths between available proxies and the desired web page. We demonstrate using a deployment of Senser on Amazon EC2 that Senser detects and mitigates censorship attempts - even by large collections of autonomous systems - while incurring reasonable performance overheads.","License":"custom, BSD-based","Language":"Java"},
{"SAFER Team":"Georgetown University","Software Name":"Tortoise","Link":"https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/projects/tortoise/","Software Description":"Tortoise is a system for rate limiting Tor at its ingress points in order to will increase the bandwidth capacity of the network and consequently improve the experience of interactive web users. The system incurs little penalty for interactive web users, while significantly decreasing the throughput for filesharers. These techniques provide incentives to filesharers to configure their Tor clients to also relay traffic, which in turn improves the network’s overall performance. Large-scale emulation results indicate that interactive users will achieve a significant speedup if even a small fraction of clients opt to run relays.","License":"Released as patch to Tor; follows Tor license at https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git?a=blob_plain;hb=HEAD;f=LICENSE","Language":"C"},
{"SAFER Team":"Naval Research Laboratory","Software Name":"Shadow","Link":"http://shadow.github.io/","Software Description":"Shadow is an open source, discrete-event network simulator that runs real applications such as Tor. Shadow combines the accuracy of emulation with the efficiency and control of simulation, achieving the best of both approaches. Shadow links to real application software and natively executes the application code during simulation, providing faithful experiments and accurate results. Shadow models and runs distributed networks using these applications on a single Linux machine, easing experiment management.","License":"BSD 3 clause, modified for U.S. Government work","Language":"C"},
{"SAFER Team":"Naval Research Laboratory","Software Name":"The Tor Path Simulator (TorPS)","Link":"http://torps.github.io/","Software Description":"TorPS provides efficient simulation of path selection over time by Tor. For each sample, it uses measurements of the Tor network and of user behavior to simulate how a Tor client selects relays. The use of actual measurements and an accurate reimplementation of Tor's path-selection algorithms provides highly realistic behavior. Also, a TorPS simulation is much faster than the Tor client itself, which allows for millions of simulations over periods of many months, allowing for an accurate estimation of the full probability distribution of client behavior over time.","License":"Custom (specific to U.S. Government work)","Language":"Python, C, Bash"},
